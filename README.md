# dropzone-postfile

A simple GUI tool that can POST huge files to http servers. 

It is a portable application that can be parametrized from the command line, and it can POST huge files to http servers.
This tool works especially well with the dropzone-backup-server project ( see https://github.com/nagylzs/dropzone-backup-server ).
